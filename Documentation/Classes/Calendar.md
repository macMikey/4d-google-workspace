# Class calendar

Class for accessing, creating, and maniuplating google calendars and events.

Extends the *_comms* class.

Wherever appropriate, I have copied/pasted information directly from Google's documentation. In some cases I have paraphrased or rewritten for clarity.

Extra spaces added in the examples to make them easier to read.

## Calendar API

### createCalendar

**Syntax:** `createCalendar( calendarName: text) -> boolean`

**Summary:** Implements [Calenders:insert](https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/calendars/insert).

**Notes:** None

**Returns:**


* If the result is unsuccessful then **false** is returned, and **this.error** will have a [cs.google.comms error object](./comms.md#error-object).
* If the result is successful, **true** is returned and the [calendar's metadata](https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/calendars#resource) is loaded into the property **this.metadata**, making the new calendar the current calendar.



**Example:**

```4d
if not($calendar.createCalendar("test")) // fail
   $errorMessage:=$ss.parseError()
   ALERT($errorMessage)
   ABORT
End If
```



### getCalendarList

**Syntax:** `getCalendarList () -> object`

**Summary:** Implements [CalendarList: list](https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/calendarList/list)

**Notes:**

* ***Does not implement any of the optional parameters***.

* ***Currently will only retrieve the first 100 calendars.***
* Returns only non-deleted non-hidden calendars that the account in the *cs.google.auth.Username* object can see.  For more information, see the **auth** class documentation.
* Does not pull the *syncToken* which is a timestamp of sorts that can be used to query Google for updates since the calendar info was retrieved.

**Returns:**

If successful, this method returns a response body object with the following structure:

### setID

**Syntax:** `setID ( calendarID : text ) -> $idIsAValidCalendar:boolean`

**Description:**

* Sets **this.metadata.ID** of the *cs.google.calendar* object to the ID passed in **calendarID**
* Checks to see if ID is a valid calendar, and returns a boolean indicating that it is or is not.
* If *ID* is a valid calendar, loads the calender properties into the **this.metadata** property per [Calendars: get](https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/calendars/get)

**Notes:**

* Does not revert **this.metadata.ID** if *ID* is not valid.  Maybe it should.

**Returns:** **True** if *ID* is valid and **False** if it is not valid

**Exampe:**

```4d
$valid:=$cal.setID($calendarID)
If (not($valid))
   Alert ("That is not a valid calendar id.")
End if
```

It is used to uniquely identify events accross calendaring systems and must be supplied when importing events via the [import](https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/events/import) method. Note that the `icalUID` and the `id` are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different `id`s while they all share the same `icalUID`s. |          |

To minimize the risk of collisions we recommend using an established UUID algorithm such as one described in [RFC4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122). If you do not specify an ID, it will be automatically generated by the server. Note that the `icalUID` and the `id` are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different `id`s while they all share the same `icalUID`s. | writable |

| `start.timeZone`                                          | `string`        | The time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. "Europe/Zurich".) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end. | writable |

This is the default status."`tentative`" - The event is tentatively confirmed."`cancelled`" - The event is cancelled (deleted). The [list](https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/events/list) method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when `syncToken` or `updatedMin` are specified) or if the `showDeleted` flag is set to `true`. The [get](https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/events/get) method always returns them. A cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type: Cancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event. Cancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the `id`, `recurringEventId` and `originalStartTime` fields populated. The other fields might be empty. All other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely. Deleted events are only guaranteed to have the `id` field populated. On the organizer's calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with `showDeleted` set to false will not return these details. If an event changes its organizer (for example via the [move](https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/events/move) operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the `id` field is guaranteed to be populated. | writable |
| `summary`                                                 | `string`        | Title of the event.                                          | writable |
| `transparency`                                            | `string`        | Whether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are: "`opaque`" - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting **Show me as** to **Busy** in the Calendar UI."`transparent`" - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting **Show me as** to **Available** in the Calendar UI. | writable |
| `updated`                                                 | `datetime`      | Last modification time of the event (as a [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp). Read-only. |          |
| `visibility`                                              | `string`        | Visibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are: "`default`" - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value."`public`" - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar."`private`" - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details."`confidential`" - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons. | writable |



## Events API

These are separated just for the purpose of keeping events functions together.

### Internal Properties

|Field|Datatype|Description|

### _eventsGetList ( { eventID : text} ) -> object

Does the work for [eventGet](#eventGet) and [eventsList](#eventsList), since those two API calls are identical except for the addition of the *eventID*, and both return objects



### _calendarGet () -> boolean

Loads the metadata for calendar *this.metadata.id* and returns whether the result is valid or not.



### _http ( http_method : TEXT ; url : TEXT ; body : TEXT ; header : object ) -> object

Overrides to ***cs.google.comms._http***: if it gets a specific error that makes it suspect that the token has expired, it force-refreshes the token and then tries again.
